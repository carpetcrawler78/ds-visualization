    "In this notebook you will work on your visualization skills. In the repo you will find a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). Every year, Kaggle conducts a survey on the topic of Data Science and Machine Learning. An invitation to participate in the survey is sent out to the entire Kaggle community. The survey is also promoted on the Kaggle website and Kaggle Twitter channel. The 2020 survey results were used as data for a Kaggle competition held at the end of the year. When evaluating the submissions, particular attention was paid to originality, a good structure/narrative and, last but not least **informative and appealing visualizations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The survey contained 35 questions, most of which were multiple-choice. These questions allowed either one or more selected answers. Responses to multiple-choice questions, where only a single choice could be selected, were recorded in individual columns. Responses to multiple selection questions (multiple choices can be selected) were split into multiple columns (with one column per answer choice).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this kind of data structure requires a lot of preprocessing before the visualization part can even begin, we decided to make the task a little easier. \n",
    "The dataset [kaggle_survey.csv](kaggle_survey.csv) that you will use for the following exercise contains only the questions whose responses where collected in a single column. \n",
    "If you need further information about the [methodology](kaggle_survey_2020_methodology.pdf) of the survey or the [questions](kaggle_survey_2020_answer_choices.pdf) and their possible answer options you will find two PDF-files with additional information in this repo."
