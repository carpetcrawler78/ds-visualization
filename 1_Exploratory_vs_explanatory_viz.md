# Exploratory vs Explanatory Visualization

## Understanding the Two Types of Data Visualization

Data visualization serves two distinct purposes in the data science workflow. Understanding the difference helps you choose the right approach and tools.

### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Visualization**

**Purpose**: To discover patterns, identify outliers, test hypotheses, and understand your data

**Characteristics:**

- Quick and iterative
- Often messy and numerous
- Created for yourself or your team
- Focus on discovery, not presentation
- Multiple variations to explore different aspects

**Best Practices for Exploratory Visualization:**

1. **Speed over polish**: Create visualizations quickly to test hypotheses
2. **Create many plots**: Don't be afraid to generate dozens of plots
3. **Use default settings**: Styling is not a priority
4. **Try multiple perspectives**: Same data, different plot types
5. **Look for anomalies**: Outliers, missing data, unexpected patterns
6. **Iterate freely**: Modify and recreate without hesitation

### **Explanatory Data Visualization**

**Purpose**: To communicate findings clearly to an audience (stakeholders, readers, the public)

**Characteristics:**

- Carefully designed and polished
- Tell a specific story or answer a specific question
- Created for an external audience
- Focus on clarity and impact
- Minimal, intentional design choices

**Best Practices for Explanatory Visualization:**

1. **Clear narrative** : Every plot should answer a specific question
2. **Simplify ruthlessly** : Remove everything that doesn't support your message
3. **Guide attention** : Use color, size, and position to highlight key insights
4. **Professional styling** : Consistent fonts, colors, and formatting
5. **Comprehensive labels** : Descriptive titles, axis labels with units, data sources
6. **Accessibility first** : Colorblind-safe palettes, sufficient contrast
7. **Context matters** : Add annotations, reference lines, or comparisons
8. **Test with audience** : Ensure your message is understood

**Recommended Tools:**

- **Matplotlib and Seaborn** for static reports and publications
- **Plotly** for interactive presentations and dashboards
- **Export formats**: SVG for publications, PNG for presentations, HTML for web

For an example see section `4.5 More Comparative Plots   Question 5` in the [Plotting Introduction Notebook](./2_Plotting_intro.ipynb).

### **The Visualization Workflow**

Most data science projects follow this progression:

1. **Explore** (80% of time): Generate many quick plots to understand your data

   - Use defaults, be messy, iterate rapidly
   - Focus: patterns, outliers, distributions, relationships
   - Be driven by questions you want to answer
2. **Refine** (15% of time): Identify the key insights worth sharing

   - Which discoveries matter most?
   - What story do they tell?
3. **Polish** (5% of time): Create explanatory visualizations

   - Clean design, clear message, professional appearance
   - Test with your target audience

>**Important**: Most visualizations you create will be exploratory. Only a small fraction will become explanatory plots for external audiences. This is normal and expected!
